## Description

The basic idea is on the one hand a web app where companies can advertise places for developers to use and share experience, on the other hand a mobile app where developers can consult companies that use the technologies of their interest and make their reservation.

During Rocketseat's Omnistack Week 9.0, we built a web app made for advertisers along with a mobile app made for users interested in renting the space. The communication between the two was made through a REST API also developed throughout the week.
